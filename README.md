Integrate Odoo 12 with Elasticsearch 7.0.0+. This module makes it easier to build Elasticsearch index for Odoo model records. More examples will be added later! It's newly refactored and more tests are still needed! 

~~ Before using it, you need to apply this change to your Odoo 12: https://github.com/oliverzgy/odoo/pull/1, this will add a search_read_json function, which returns a json compatible seach results, good for building ES index. ~~

It could be used as a starter kit to build your own module related to ES!
